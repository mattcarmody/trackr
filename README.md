# trackr
An automated assistant that records my progress on sites I frequent.

Tracking my progress helps me keep up with long term learning goals. This script monitors my progress on some of the sites I use regularly. It runs daily using cron and logs my progress on Duolingo, Codewars, Chess.com, Goodreads and HackerRank. Data is being kept and visualized in a .xlsx spreadsheet at the moment.
